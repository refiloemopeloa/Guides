# Windows shortcuts

Shortcuts are essential to boosting your productivity.

## Reset your graphics card

Sometimes, unexpected things happen on your screen. Most times, this can be fixed with a quick graphics card reset. The keys to press are:

<button>Windows</button> + <button>Ctrl</button> + <button>Shift</button> + <button>B</button>

## Mapping shortcuts to open specific apps

You can map shortcuts to open a specific app by doing the following:

1. Add the app shortcut to the **Desktop**.
2. Right-click on the app shortcut and select **Properties**.
3. Select the **Shortcut** window.
4. Under the **Shortcut key** option, click where it says **None**.
5. Enter the keyboard shortcut you want to open this app.
6. Click **Okay**.

#### Note

1. You can only map to a some combination of `Ctrl + Alt`.
2. You cannot map to existing shortcuts, so ensure to check the shortcut before mapping it.
3. You can't access the shortcuts on the desktop.
