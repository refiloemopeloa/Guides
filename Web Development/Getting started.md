# Getting Started

House keeping before starting

## Environment

This section will cover the following:

1. Operating System
2. Web browser
3. Code editor
4. GitHub

### Operating system

#### Linux

Ideal. Recommended. Use any that you are familiar with. If you need suggestions, Ubuntu is great.

#### macOS

Gets the job done. Needs a few programs installed before getting into it, but works just as well.

#### Windows

Don't... Just don't. If you don't have a choice, you can do one of three things

1. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)
2. Virtual machine. I recommend VirtualBox
3. Dual-boot a Linux distro

I recommend using this guide from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) if you are on windows:

### Web browser

As much as I hate how resource hungry Google Chrome is, it really is ideal for web development. I recommend any of the following

1. Chrome
2. Any Chromium-based browser

I am using Microsoft Edge, a Chromium-based (highly underrated).

### Code editors

Code is just text at the end of the day and if you really have to, any vanilla text editor will do great. However, there are many ways to lift a heavy object... just because you can use your own hands, doesn't mean you should.

There are plethora of editors to use. My recommendations are

1. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you prefer a lightweight editor
2. [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) if you love versatile IDE's

### GitHub

To set up `git` on your local machine, refer to this guide: <a href="../git/git local machine setup.md">git local machine setup</a>
