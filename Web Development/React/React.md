React is a front-end framework that allows you to create responsive, scalable web applications.

Before we do anything, let us set up our environment.

## Setup

To create any React application, you have to have `Node.js` installed. Check out this guide on setting up `Node.js`: [Node.js](https://github.com/refiloemopeloa/Guides/blob/main/Web%20Development/JS/Node.js.md)

## Create a React App

First, create a directory called `my-first-react-app`. Then `cd` into the directory and type the following in your terminal:

```shell
npx create-react-app app_name
```

This command initializes a local git repo, and installs template dependencies for React.

## Running your React App

Once you have created your React App, you can any of the following commands to run it in different modes:

```shell
# Start the development server. 
npm start 

#Bundle the app into static files for production. 
npm run build 

# Starts the test runner
npm test 
```
